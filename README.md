Hi, I'm Lex.  
I focus on practical penetration testing ‚Äî from web to internal networks, and eventually into binary exploitation.  
Currently building custom tools to support hands-on learning and real-world engagements.

### üó°Ô∏è Hacker Mottos

Persistence beats resistance.  
Every system has a weakness; it‚Äôs just a matter of finding it.  
Exploit the impossible, master the unknown.  
Behind every lock is a logic waiting to be broken.  
In code we trust, in flaws we find truth.  
No network is too secure, no protocol too complex.  
Attack smart, defend stronger.  
Learning is the ultimate exploit.  
The best backdoors are the ones you build yourself.  
Hack to understand, not to destroy.
